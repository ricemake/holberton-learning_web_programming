    <h1>Learn by doing</h1>
      <p>Project-based learning is a proven, alternative learning methodology to the traditional teacher-led lecture and memorization educational method.

Rather than teaching a lot of theory and having students occasionally apply a fraction of their knowledge on a class project, we do the opposite. We give our students increasingly difficult programming challenges to solve with minimal initial directions on how to solve them. As a result, our students learn to look for the theory and tools they need, how to understand them, how to apply them, and how to work as a team.

Through learning by doing and learning how to rapidly adopt new skills and methodologies, Holberton students are better prepared to succeed in this ever evolving industry.</p>

    <h1>Learn from others</h1>
      <p>Peer learning is an educational practice in which students interact with their fellow students to reach their educational goals. Coupled with project-based learning, Holberton students are encouraged to unleash their creativity and learn how to solve practical challenges by working as a team. After all, successful companies are the result of successful teams, not just successful individuals.

We don't have formal classrooms or teachers — instead, our students collaborate, share their knowledge, and help each other.

Peer education is proven to foster a very constructive learning culture, as students are immersed into an environment where everyone is driven to help each other.</p>

    <h1>Soft skills and career development</h1>
      <p>Being a successful software engineer is more than just coding solo at a computer. The most successful engineers make their impact through brainstorming with peers, sharing techniques, pitching ideas, writing technical articles, and organizing meetups.

In fact, Google recently found the seven top characteristics of success at Google are all soft skills.

Our project-based curriculum pushes our students for better communication and teamwork, and our events, meetups, and talks help our students hone interviewing skills, tackle coding challenges, attend events with industry insiders, and more.</p>

    <h1>Learn how to learn</h1>
      <p>At Holberton, we don’t just teach students how to code or give the answers to the problems — in the real world, that’s not how it works.

Instead, the intensive curriculum is designed around collaborative, project-based learning that trains every Holberton graduate the coding skills that will help them land a job, and the learning skills that will help our graduates sustain their careers.

Holberton students are trained, challenged, and tested on the technologies of today, but the learning skills they develop here will prepare them to adapt to and learn the technologies and the coding languages of tomorrow.</p>

    <h1>Professional advisors</h1>
      <p>With a commitment to inspiring students and advancing a rigorous academic environment, the leaders of Holberton School ensure our curriculum adapts and responds to contemporary issues, industry changes, and new technologies.

Our professional advisors, mentors, and affiliated industry leaders not only keep our curriculum up to date with the latest techniques and skill sets, but they also give some of their time to our students in fireside chats, and professional networking opportunities.</p>
